## Field Trip Project

### Project Summary
For my web page I would create a page for the artifact created by indigenous peoples. The colors of the artifacts are still so vibrant and beautiful, ith makes you feel as though they were created last week rather than three or four generations ago.
Brief description of your what your project is about and why you chose that topic.

### Core Webpages
For the main home page of the website, I would have a header showing the name of the museum with links that woud take the user to the main website or other artifacts. For the first section, I would have a hero image of the most interesting aspect of the artifact with a smart little catche phrase to go along with the image. The user would be able to scroll down the sie from their and get to learn more about the artifact. There would be an interactable spot in the website where the user would be able to do a virtual reality tour walk through of the actual floor of the museum so that they can experience the artifacts as though they were truly at the museum themself.
List core webpages and briefly describe the page of them. Include intractable features for the web app.

### Design Choices
When creating the webpages, I would reference the original website in order to show that the artifact is apart of the main museum I would also add a creative spin and and pull in colors from the artifacts into the webpages themself by making the background colors more vibrant along with any buttons that would make the user experience feel more immersed into the story behind the artifact. The original website is white with orange buttons and logos and I would want to stick with that for the header and footer, but for the rest of the page I would use black background with colors pulled from the artifacts of the indigenous peopleâ€™s artwork.

List any websites that you might reference to influence your styling choices. List any colors used and what they were used for.

Describe your data structure with rationale.
