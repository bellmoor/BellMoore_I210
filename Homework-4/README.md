Story summary
-You are hungry for dinner. What will you be eating?

Key Takeaways
- Using functions like chooseRestauraunt() and chooseHome() that execute when a certain criteria is met.
- Updating DOM to reflect user choices 
- using poropmt("Do you order 'teak' or 'seafood'?") to gather input and confirm() for user interaction 
- organizing code and creating functions for lines of code that will be repeating so I dont have to write them multiple times.
- DOM Manipulation that cleas current choices for new ones so user only sees next choices using choicesRefinnerHTML = ""
