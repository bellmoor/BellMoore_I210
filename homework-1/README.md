### Websites vs Web Applications
A website is used to provide people with information - it can be interactive, but to a minmal extent. A web application is a app that can be run in the browser. It is very interactive and can save user information. HTML is used to create the basic web page structure. CSS makes the structure look nice. JavaScript allows us to add interactive and dynamic elements

### VS Code & Extensions
VS Code is a program that allows us to write code for making websites or web applications. We can add extensions to customize our workflow, such as Prettier, live server, pets etc.

### Version Control, Git, & GitHub
With git we can create repositories and commit changes or pull changes all directly in VS Code. We work in our repositories, then go to source control in VS Code and from their we can commit/push our changes.It is important to always give each commit a different title to briefly describe what change was made.

### Markdown & Documentation
Markdown is a type of computer language that allows people to describe what is going on in their code or use as notes. It lets people read about what is happening in the project easliy without having to try and decipher through their code. There are some specific syntaxes to use to make headings, bold or italics, lists, etc.
