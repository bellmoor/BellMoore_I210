      New life was discovered on Mars just ten hours ago. NASA - despite serious budget cuts - was successful in creating an artificial intelligence mining rover to the planet. This rover - The Floofer Detector - found an undiscovered cave entrance on the surface. The Floofer Detector scanned the entrance and found an unexpected heat signal that it followed. What it did net was unprecedanted. The AI Rover went into the cave and took itself apart to fit into the 2 foot wide opening. It left any non-vital protective pieces outside the cave opening and entered. When it got to a wider opening in the dark space, it spun in circles, thouroughly dizzying the scientists wathching the streamed footogae. When the Floofer Detector stopped, there was something in the camera view that scientists had never seen and didn't know what t omake of it. They saw a Martian.
