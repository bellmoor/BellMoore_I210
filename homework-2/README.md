## Assignment 1: Git Readme

### Blog Topic Summary

I chose to write an april fools blog post about discovering fluffy life on Mars because I thought it would make the homework more fun for me to do.

### Key Takeaways


- I used css to center my divs and the text inside them by using display: flex and justify-content: center.
- I used margins to make sure the content was not touching eachother. I could have used padding but margins are easier for me to understand.
- I used classes along with the divs for each section so I could style the different sections of the page individually.
- I added a favicon of an alien
- I used different fonts for headings compared to the rest of the text usng font-family
- I added a hero image using css by using background-image with a url to the image and background-repeat: no-repeat; background-size: cover; so that the image fit into the space. I used padding to make the hero image a more fitting size for the page.
